# chvrches-processing

This project got its name because my inspiration comes from a CHVRCHES concert. During the band's performance, a flashing grid appeared in the background and caught my eye. For my first processing project, I wanted to replicate this. Using the Minim BeatDetect library, the grid moves to the beat of the song.

You can download the song at https://soundcloud.com/enjoytunesofficial/miza-nahz-original-mix or replace it with an mp3 of your choice. To make things easy, the song file should be in this project folder. 

29 June 2016: I am working on creating a shader for my grid. Afterwards, I want to make this into a 3D processing project.
