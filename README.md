# Music Visualizer Using Processing

My inspiration for this project comes from a CHVRCHES concert. During the band's performance, a flashing grid appeared in the background and caught my eye. For my first processing project, I wanted to replicate this. Using the Minim BeatDetect library, the grid moves to the beat of the song.

You can download the song at https://soundcloud.com/enjoytunesofficial/miza-nahz-original-mix or replace it with an mp3 of your choice. To make things easy, the song file should be in this project folder.
